# Marlin Firmware for the Folgertech FT-i3 Mega (EZABL/E3D Titan Aero)
<img align="right" src="../../raw/1.1.x/buildroot/share/pixmaps/logo/marlin-250.png" />

## Additional Information

This firmware is configured for the Folgertech FT-i3 Mega for [Paul (Where Nerdy is Cool)](http://wherenerdyiscool.com/) and uses [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3441535) Titan Aero mount.

*Note: This is still a work in progress. I'm currently working on a mount for the the Y-axis limit switch since you lose about 40mm with this mod.*
